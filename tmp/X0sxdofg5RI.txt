The family of Simone Jasmine, better known as the Queen of the South, has rubbished claims that she was involved in murder or attempted murder. Jasmine is believed to have led a ruthless drug gang in Wentworth, Durban, which supplied heroin to townships around the city. She was laid to rest today after being shot dead last Thursday by a group of men. ENCA's Litiwim Dluli reports. A send-off fit for a queen. Friends and family of the late Simone Jasmine gathered on Marine Drive, The Bluff, where a fancy motorcade made its way into her home for a final goodbye. In the heart of Durban, specifically in Wentworth, a wave of mixed emotions swept through the community upon learning about the tragic demise of Simone Jasmine, a prominent figure known for leading one of the city's most ruthless drug gangs. Jasmine, often referred to as Mony in the streets, was introduced to the dark world of gangs by a boyfriend, as revealed by police and community insiders speaking anonymously. Her life story bore an eerie resemblance to that of Teresa Mendoza, the main character in a popular Mexican telenovela, Queen of the South. Just like Mendoza, Jasmine's journey began with love and tragedy. After her first boyfriend, a fellow gang member, was brutally murdered, Jasmine found herself pulled into the drug trade. Mirroring Mendoza's path, Jasmine established her own drug distribution network, leading to immense wealth but also entangling her in the perilous world she had chosen. Jasmine's base of operations was Lansdowne Road, within a complex of tenement flats dubbed the Barracks. Here, her influence reached legendary proportions. To those outside her territory, she was the feared Black Widow, seemingly orchestrating all the shootings and drug-related chaos in Wentworth. However, to the impoverished residents of the Barracks, she was a revered figure. Despite the violence that plagued her domain, Jasmine displayed a complex persona, dressing alternately as a tomboy or an elegant lady, depending on the situation. Jasmine was arrested in September, along with some of her alleged gang members on charges of murder, attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder. She was out on bail when she was killed. Remarkably intelligent and street smart, Jasmine aimed higher than mere drug dealing. She aspired to be a wholesaler, swiftly establishing distribution channels to dealers in Umlazi, Lamontville and Quamashu. Estimates placed her gang's daily drug profits at around R200,000, funds she used to invest in property and Uber taxis. Yet, her vast network brought its own set of problems. Conflicts frequently erupted, leading to swift and brutal retribution against those who dared question her authority. In recent times, Jasmine and her cartel gang faced intensified scrutiny from the newly established KwaZulu-Natal Anti-Gang Unit. Several gang members, including a purportedly corrupt Wentworth policeman linked to them, were arrested. Despite her efforts to protect herself, Jasmine's life was tragically cut short. In a cruel twist of fate, assassins who had meticulously surveilled her residence ambushed her in an Uber, ending her tumultuous story on the emergency room floor of a Durban hospital. The intricate web of alliances and enmities that Jasmine wove during her reign has left investigators with a daunting task. The list of possible suspects is long and varied, ranging from rival gangs within Wentworth, such as the Hollywood Gang, Drain Rats, G-Section, and Destroyers, to external adversaries in Umlazi. Internally, suspicion looms large among her own gang members, some of whom are now incarcerated and puzzled by her release on bail. The motives behind her tragic demise remain shrouded in the complexities of her criminal empire. You must stare the art of gold. And uh, see what's been published in the papers and all, it's not true. She wasn't involved in any murders and, you know, and she's never, ever been convicted of everything, of anything. So, I don't understand why people are talking a whole lot of nonsense and posting their rubbish comments on Facebook. We're suffering over here, you know what I'm saying? Must stare the good art, she helped a lot of people. She wasn't a bad person. Jasmine's mother says some family members were home when Jasmine was killed, just as she entered her Uber. My grandson was also present, so they saw everything that happened. As it happened, where it started and how it ended. Police have opened an investigation into Jasmine's murder. Letiwumzuli, Durban.
